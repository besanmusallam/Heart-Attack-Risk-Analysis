# Heart Attack Prediction Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Heart Attack Prediction dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 8763 records and 26 columns. Below are some key statistics and information about the dataset:

- The dataset contains information about patients' demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and heart attack risk.
- There are no missing values in the dataset.
- The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

### Numerical Data Distribution

- A distribution plot was created to visualize the distribution of numerical features such as age, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.
- The data appears to have a uniform distribution rather than a normal distribution.

### Categorical Data Distribution

- Pie charts were used to visualize the distribution of gender and diet categories.
- Count plots were used to analyze the distribution of diabetes and smoking among genders, as well as the distribution of smoking among countries.

### Relationships Between Features

- Count plots were used to visualize the relationship between smoking and diabetes, as well as the relationship between heart attack risk and smoking.
- A scatterplot was used to explore the relationship between cholesterol levels and smoking.

### Income Disparity Between Genders

- Histograms were used to compare the income distribution between males and females. No significant difference in income was observed.

### Heart Attack Risk Analysis

- A count plot was used to analyze the relationship between cholesterol levels and heart attack risk.
- Another count plot was used to visualize the number of heart attacks by country.

## Conclusion

- Smoking appears to be a significant risk factor for diabetes and heart attacks.
- There is no significant income disparity between males and females in the dataset.
- Nigeria has the highest number of smokers among the countries in the dataset.

Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to heart attack risk and the distribution of health-related behaviors among different demographics.
